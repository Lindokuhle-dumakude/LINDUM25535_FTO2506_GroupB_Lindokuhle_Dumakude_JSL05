# Task Management System

## 📌 Project Description

The **JSL05 Task Management system** is a simple yet functional Kanban-style board that allows users to create, edit, and organize tasks into different statuses: **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**. It is built to practice modular JavaScript, DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage persistence. The project demonstrates building a real-world interactive UI with dynamic rendering and state management.
